## Component vs Page

React breaks the UI code into components. There are many types of components and ways you can create them. Proem-UI comes pre-configured with a specific component architecture set up that follows well researched common practices

At the highest level, there are two sets of components:

 - **Pages** (located in `/pages`) - This is the high level state of your app. Think of these as each screen in the app. Each screen should be in its own subdirectory (i.e. `/pages/Dashboard/index.js` or `/pages/About/index.js`). Each page subdirectory can also contain specialized components that are specific to those pages (i.e. /pages/Dashboard/DashboardSidebar.js ). However, we suggest keeping this to a minimum and favor putting most of your components in the `/components` directory. When in doubt, use `/components` 
 - **Components** (located in `/components`) - These are the shared (or potentially shared) components in your app. This can be anything from typographic content to dialogs, to entire calculator components.
  
Use components as much as possible. Multiple small chunks of code are far easier to maintain then single large files of code. The smaller and more specialized/focused your components are, the better. 

> Suggestion: We suggest that only page components connect directly to actions (scripts in `/actions`) using the 
> `actionProvider` and reducers store. Those objects should then be passed into components. This keeps the access to
> these functions focused, and helps keep your components mutable/decoupled.

## Pages
Pages are the main states of your app. They are given access to the global data store using `react-redux`'s `connect`
function. They are given access to the action scripts using `actionProvider` from `actions`. For more information on 
the data flow to/from pages, see [Redux/Data Store Guide](store.md) 

Here is an example of a Page using `connect`/`actionProvider`:
```react
import React, { Component } from 'react';
import { connect } from 'react-redux';

import Actions, { actionProvider } from 'actions';

import { MyDomainArray } from '../../domain';

const propMap = store => ({
    list: store.items.list,
    fetching: store.items.fetching,
    fetched: store.items.fetched,
});

class MyPage extends Component {
    static propTypes = {
        list: PropTypes.instanceOf(MyDomainArray).isRequired,
        fetching: PropTypes.bool.isRequired,
        fetched: PropTypes.bool.isRequired,
        actions: PropTypes.instanceOf(Actions).isRequired,
    };

    static defaultProps = {};

    componentDidMount() {
        const { actions: { AppStateActions } } = this.props;
        AppStateActions.setTitle('Example Page');
    }

    render() {
        const {
            list, fetched, fetching,
        } = this.props;

        if (!fetched || fetching) return <div>Loading...</div>;

        return (
            <ul>
                {list.map(item => (
                    <li key="item.id">{item.text}</li>
                ))}
            </ul>
        );
    }
}

export default connect(propMap, actionProvider)(MyPage);

```


## Components
There are two types of components you can create within React, [function components & class components](https://reactjs.org/docs/components-and-props.html). Function components allow a simpler lightweight component, while class components are more comprehensive.

### Simplest Function Component
The most basic of components:
```react
import React from 'react';

export default function MyBasicComponent() {
    return (
        <div>Hello World!</div>
    );
}
```

### Typical Function Component
The previous example is helpful, and there are many cases when youâ€™d want to create such a basic component to encapsulate your code as much as possible. However, here is a a more robust example of a function component:
```react
import React, { useState } from 'react';
import PropTypes from 'prop-types';
import {
    Dialog, DialogContent, DialogTitle, DialogActions, Button, IconButton,
} from '@material-ui/core';

import { InfoIcon } from 'utils/Icons';

export default function MyBasicDialog({ title, message }) {
    const [isOpen, setOpen] = useState(false);

    return (
        <>
            <IconButton onClick={() => { setOpen(true); }}>
                <InfoIcon />
            </IconButton>
            <Dialog open={isOpen} onClose={() => { setOpen(false); }}>
                <DialogTitle id="dialog-title">
                    {title}
                </DialogTitle>
                <DialogContent>
                    {message}
                </DialogContent>
                <DialogActions>
                    <Button onClick={() => { setOpen(false); }} color="primary">
                        OK
                    </Button>
                </DialogActions>
            </Dialog>
        </>
    );
}

MyBasicDialog.propTypes = {
    title: PropTypes.string,
    message: PropTypes.string.isRequired,
};

MyBasicDialog.defaultProps = {
    title: 'My Basic Dialog',
};
```
This Uses:

 - [Classless React Component](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-intro.html) with a [state hook](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-state.html)
 - [Material-UI Dialogs](https://material-ui.com/components/dialogs/) & [Buttons](https://material-ui.com/components/buttons/)

### Class Component
For scenarios where your component needs to be more robust, a Class component adds more flexibility, but is a bit more verbose:
```react
import React, { Component } from 'react';
import PropTypes from 'prop-types';
import { Typography } from '@material-ui/core';
import { withStyles } from '@material-ui/core/styles';

const styles = theme => ({
    root: {
        padding: theme.spacing(),
    },
});

class MessageBox extends Component {
    static propTypes = {
        message: PropTypes.string.isRequired,
        classes: PropTypes.object.isRequired,
    };

    static defaultProps = {};

    state = {};

    render() {
        const {
            message, classes,
        } = this.props;

        return (
            <Typography className={classes.root}>
                {message}
            </Typography>
        );
    }
}

export default withStyles(styles)(MessageBox);

```

## Component Storybook
[Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/) is an incredibly powerful tool used to test individual UI components in isolation as well as create a visual component library for your project. It comes packaged and preconfigured with Proem-UI. To start Storybook run:
```shell script
> npm run storybook
```
Once Storybook is started it will automatically open the browser for you (or visit: `http://localhost:6006/`). Once started, it will live-reload changes you make to your components. 

Each of your components should have a storybook. For example, the `MyBasicDialog` component we created in the earlier example would be in `/components/MyBasicDialog/index.j`s. Alongside this component there should be a `/components/MyBasicDialog/index.story.js`:
```react
import React from 'react';
import MyBasicDialog from '.';

export default { title: 'MyBasicDialog' };

export const withMessage = () => <MyBasicDialog message="Hello World!" />;

export const withTitleAndMessage = () => (
    <MyBasicDialog
        title="Hello"
        message="World!"
    />
);
```

## Icons

It is strongly suggested that all icons in your application be SVG icons. Your Proem-UI app can use 
[Material-UI Icons](https://material-ui.com/components/icons/), but also provides an optional method for introducing 
your own custom SVG based icons. 
 
Add each of your custom icons to `utils/Icons`, for example this `ArrowDownIcon.js`:
```react
import React from 'react';
import SvgIcon from '@material-ui/core/SvgIcon';

export default props => (
    <SvgIcon {...props}>
        <path d="M7.41 8.59L12 13.17l4.59-4.58L18 10l-6 6-6-6 1.41-1.41z" />
    </SvgIcon>
);

```
Then add your icon to `utils/Icons/index.js`. You can now access you cusotm icons inside any component:
```react
import { ArrowDownIcon } from 'utils/Icons';
...
<ArrowDownIcon />
```
